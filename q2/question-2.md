## Question 2

a. I am 1 billion seconds old today. What day was I born?

b. Pretend it is Wednesday, October 24, 2018. A Swiss dispatcher, Lara, will be coordinating the schedule for the next 1 week of deliveries for a team of drivers in Jordan. She can only schedule deliveries the day before they are set to be delivered. Assuming that Lara is working from her local timezone, the drivers work in theirs, and you are in the Pacific Timezone, how would you advise Lara to set the delivery completion times over each of the following 7 days?

Assume that a Jordanian customer from that set of deliveries complains that he didn't receive the expected text/SMS message on Saturday, for a delivery at 16:00, local time. Assuming that the telephony logs are in Pacific timezone, what timestamp would you look for in the logs?
