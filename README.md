## Support Engineering Manager coding challenge
# Description

Congratulations on being considered for the Support Engineering Manager role at Onfleet!

You will find README files in each of the directories with prompts and/or instructions. Please complete each to the best of your ability and explain how you arrived at your solution (commit history and comments in the case of programming).  We will review your work at the end of the allotted time. If you have any questions, email alex@onfleet.com 

We respect your time and don't want you to spend much more than an hour in total on these.

# Submitting your work
